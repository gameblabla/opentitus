INSTALLATION
==============

This game will not work on the Sega Dreamcast Sakura Tensei edition or on some dreamcasts manufactured after October 2000.
If that's your case then your only option is the GDEMU device.

OpenTitus requires "Titus the fox" MS-DOS port files or Moktar.
It requires the following files :

SPREXP.SQZ
TITRE.SQZ
MENU.SQZ
TITREEGA.SQZ
MENUEGA.SQZ
STABLE.BIN
LEVEL2.SQZ
LEVEL0.SQZ

LEVELC.SQZ
LEVELE.SQZ
LEVEL8.SQZ
LEVEL4.SQZ
LEVELJ.SQZ
LEVELG.SQZ
TITUS.SQZ

Put all the files in titus.
For Moktar, put them in "moktar" instead.

You can burn the cdi image with ImgBurn and the Padus plugin, burn at 10x and if you can, 12x.
